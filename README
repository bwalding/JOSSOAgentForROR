Introduction
=============
    This plugin is used for integrating SSO with JOSSO1.7 in RubyOnRails projects.
    If you developed some projects with JAVA, PHP, ROR... 
    However, some day you want to integrate all the projects with JOSSO, you will find that you can't get a absolute JOSSO agent for ROR. 
    Yes, You are right, this is my situation for developed a JOSSO agent for ROR projects called JOSSOAgentForROR. 
    Maybe I should make a good name, whatever.
    
    Your need and only need is use the "inject_josso_agent" method in the ApplicationController directly
    And modity the josso_config.yml file in the directory "Vendor/rorjossoagent/config".
    Please follow the Example.

Example
=======
    (1) create a Ruby On Rails application with NetBeans IDE and create a Controller such as TestController.
    (2) use the 'inject_josso_agent' method in the ApplicationController.
        class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
            # The ling below is you need to do.
            inject_josso_agent
            helper :all
            protect_from_forgery # :secret => '82080e75741b9780ebdb607d770322ae'
        end

    (3) modify the josso_config file, if you don't have josso
        you can deploy a josso application or use the default configration in josso_config.yml,
        the username is: handy.wang@finalist.hk, the password is: 123456
        development:
            josso_root: your josso application root url here, such as 'http://localhost:8080/josso'.
            partner_application_entry_url: your application home here, such as 'http://localhost:3000/test'
        test:
            josso_root: your josso application root url here, such as 'http://localhost:8080/josso'.
            partner_application_entry_url: your application home here, such as 'http://localhost:3000/test'
        production:
            josso_root: your josso application root url here, such as 'http://localhost:8080/josso'.
            partner_application_entry_url: your application home here, such as 'http://localhost:3000/test'
    (4) Run the server by NetBean or command: ruby script/server
        And access the url 'partner_application_entry_url', you will see JOSSO login page,
        login with the username and password I told in the top words. OK, that's all.
